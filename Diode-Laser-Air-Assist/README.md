# Air-Assist nozzle

Air-Assist nozzle for unknown Chinese diode laser module.  
10W Output Power, without air-assist it's only worth engraving, due to high heat and smoke. 10% power engrave wood (not mark), so need some air for cooling path while cutting.  

### Dimensions

 - 6mm hole (for polyurethane air hose, optionally with quick connector)  
 - Outer dimensions: 47,5mm * 43mm  
 - Height: 35mm
 - Mounting holes center distance: 32mm  

This was designed in just a few minutes, so ventilation pads are not easily editable.  
For that reason there is another part without vent pads, so you can edit dimensions and draw your own ventilation pads.
